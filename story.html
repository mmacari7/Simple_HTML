            <h3>A short story by Michael Macari</h3>
            <p>It was a cold Friday night during the winter upstate New York. Myself, and multiple friends were spending the night in casually drinking 
                and sharing some laughs. Suddenly, Cameron shouts aloud "We should go out tonight!". We all looked at him crooked, as it had been snowing heavily 
                all day, and there was at least 3 feet of snow on the ground, the plows could barely keep up. Katie, spouts this logic to Cameron, acting as 
                if she had no idea that there was so much snow outside. Cameron replies "Who cares! It will be a snowy adventure!" Feeling a bit silly from the 
                wine we had been sipping, we all agreed that it would make for a good adventure. I was not onboard with this endeavor, but the group was insistent
                that I join, so we headed out on our little journey into town.
            </p>

            <p>Upon heading outside, it was a barren and icey tundra. The winds were high and the snow was deep. Laughing and enjoying eachothers company, 
                we pressed on with our walk through the frozen lands. When we had gotten into town we were all pretty chilled from the walk, and excited to get inside
                for some warmth when all of the sudden Cameron shouts "I lost my boot!". "What do you mean you lost your boot?" I queried. "I don't know when or how, but
                my boot seems to be missing." claimed Cameron. I look down at Camerons feet in disbelief, to find that in fact, the man had somehow lost a boot. 
                I asked if he had remembered to put on both boots before we left, to which Cameron replies "Of course I left with two boots! How would I not remember to
                put both boots on!". I couldn't help but think that if the man was capable of losing a boot and not realizing it on the entire walk there, then he was also
                entirely capable of forgetting to put on both boots. Alas I decided to give him benefit of the doubt. "Well where could it be?" I said. He began to raddle off
                a list of location as follows:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The outside of my aparment</li>
                <li>The outside of the church we passed</li>
                <li>On the sidewalk of Finnick Road</li>
                <li>Under the car near the fire station</li> 
            </ul>
            <p>"Cameron that is a lot of vague locations to go hunting for a boot in this weather." I claimed. Cameron agreed that the effort to find his boot was more than 
                it was worth. However we were still in the pickle of how Cameron was going to walk home without a boot through the snow. Although I saw no reason that he could 
                not walk back without a boot, just the same as we had gotten there. "I got it!", Cameron shouts. "I will lay in the middle of the street and the snow plow can push 
                me home." I began to say "Cameron I don't think it works like tha......" and before I knew it he had already sprinted off. Moments later the group and I were
                alarmed to the sound of honking. We peered off into the fog of snow only to see Cameron, laying there in the middle of the road, with the snow plow right 
                in front of him. "No Cameron!", we all shouted "Get out of the road!". The gentlemen driving the plow was also very clearly displeased with Camerons behavior.
                Cameron shouting back at the driver "GO JUST GO! ITLL ROLL ME INTO A SNOW BALL AND I CAN ROLL HOME". The driver could not help but to let out a very hardy laugh.
                The driver still somewhat displeased now turns to us and says "Please get your friend". We got Cameron out of the road and scolded him for his stupid actions, 
                to which he replied "But it will make for a good story huh?". We all begun to laugh, and could not disagree. We headed home after that, Cameron with a single boot
                on his left foot back to the aparment. 
            </p>
            <p>We never were actually able to actually find Camerons boot. Cameron searched around the snow for a long time in all of the vague locations, and the boot was 
                still nowhere to be found. The season continued on and eventually we all forgot about the boot. It was a very snowy winter, and there was none less than a foot 
                of snow on the ground throughout the entirety of the season. Finally, months later, spring came around, the birds begun chirping and the warmth of the sun could 
                be felt again on your skin. Have to love that vitamin D. It was an April morning, and I was just waking up to make my morning coffee (as I always do to start my day). 
                When I noticed out my balcony door, that there was a small black piece of cloth sticking out slightly from the melting snow, but I thought nothing of it. 
                I continued on my morning routine and headed outside to start my day. I was headed down the walkway when the small piece of cloth sticking out of the snow
                had again grabbed my attention. Still completely clueless as to what it was, I found myself victim to my own curiosity (as I often do) and headed over to the 
                small piece of cloth. I grabbed it, and gave it a hard yank, only to find there it was..... the missing boot.
