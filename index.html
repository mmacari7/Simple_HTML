            <h2>Short biography of Michael Macari</h2>
            <p>
                Michael was no ordinary dragon, as a matter in fact he was not a dragon at all. Michael Macari is whats commonly known as a wyvern.
                He was born on a cold day in September in the year 12,034 B.C. (because wyverns are immortal). His diet varies, but consists of primarily meat.
                One could go as far to say that he is carnivorous (as most wyverns typically are). Mike lays dormant most of the time. Like most wyverns
                Mike tends to go on a feeding frenzy, and then hibernate for a couple thousand years. In Mikes free time when not hibernating, or feeding aggressively,
                he likes to fly out and pick flowers for his cave because flowers are beautiful and smell pretty. He also loves treasure, gold silver you name it! 
                His cave is filled with all sorts of treasures! Greedy men sometimes walk in, and try to steal his pretty treasures. Mike however can sense these 
                presence because he is a wyvern. Even though he picks flowers and can remain mostly dosile, if you try to steal Mikes treasure while he lay dormant,
                he will wake and incinerate all who pose threat with his mighty breath of fire. Mike also hand sanitizes his wings very often because hygene is key to 
                a life of longevity.
